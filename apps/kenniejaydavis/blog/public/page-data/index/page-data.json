This observation led to his namesake law:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can identify with Cunningham's Law and the common sentiment that having the courage to posit and be wrong is much harder than pointing out when someone else is wrong.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is why I have delayed blogging for so long:</p>\n<h3>What if I'm Wrong?</h3>\n<p>I have started to blog many times before with the goal of sharing my experience and knowledge with the community only to quit each time fearing that I might publish erroneous information and be shunned forever when it is discovered that I am a fraud.</p>\n<p>Every time I wrote an article, doubt set in I inevitably found myself contemplating one of the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Did I solve this problem correctly?</em></li>\n<li><em>Is this applicable to anyone else or too specific to my use case?</em></li>\n<li><em>Am I qualified to write about this? What do I really know?</em></li>\n<li><em>Someone else has already written about this; no sense in reinventing the wheel</em></li>\n<li><em>What if I am wrong and readers realize that <strong>after</strong> they have taken my advice and find themselves at a point of no return?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">Imposter syndrome</a> is real.</p>\n<p>Not knowing how far any actionable advice I provide might reach when there is a chance I am wrong is a terrifying thought. And yet, I have come to realize the following:</p>\n<h3>Being Wrong is Okay</h3>\n<p>After reflecting on Cunningham's Law for some time now, I have a new perspective:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having the courage to openly be wrong is the easiest way to create the opportunity to learn what is right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that is why I have committed to starting this blog.</p>\n<p>I know not everything I share here will be correct and my hope is that, together, we can all learn what is right.</p>\n<h2>What's Next?</h2>\n<p>I have worked on some interesting projects recently that I want to share. Hopefully what I have to share will help others and generate feedback which can only lead to better solutions for everyone, myself included.</p>\n<p>I am currently working on articles and sample code for the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://nx.dev\">Nx</a> together with <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/dynamic-config/\">CircleCI and dynamic configuration</a></li>\n<li>Building <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0\">.NET 6 Minimal APIs</a> with <a href=\"https://www.nx-dotnet.com/\">nx-dotnet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these topics interest you, please bookmark my blog. I will be sure to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenniejaydavis\">post updates on twitter</a> when new posts are published. And of course, feedback is a gift, so if I publish anything that is wrong, do not hesitate to offer the correct answer.</p>"}]}},"pageContext":{}},
