title: Wrong Answers Are Okay

description: Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." Chances are I will be posting wrong answers on this blog in hopes that together we can arrive at correct ones.

[Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham), developer of the first [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), observed that people are much more willing to correct a wrong answer than they are to answer a question. This observation led to his namesake law:

> "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

I can identify with Cunningham's Law and the common sentiment that having the courage to posit and be wrong is much harder than pointing out when someone else is wrong.

In fact, this is why I have delayed blogging for so long:

### What if I'm Wrong?

I have started to blog many times before with the goal of sharing my experience and knowledge with the community only to quit each time fearing that I might publish erroneous information and be shunned forever when it is discovered that I am a fraud.

Every time I wrote an article, doubt set in I inevitably found myself contemplating one of the following questions:

- _Did I solve this problem correctly?_
- _Is this applicable to anyone else or too specific to my use case?_
- _Am I qualified to write about this? What do I really know?_
- _Someone else has already written about this; no sense in reinventing the wheel_
- _What if I am wrong and readers realize that **after** they have taken my advice and find themselves at a point of no return?_

[Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is real.

Not knowing how far any actionable advice I provide might reach when there is a chance I am wrong is a terrifying thought. And yet, I have come to realize the following:

### Being Wrong is Okay

After reflecting on Cunningham's Law for some time now, I have a new perspective:

> Having the courage to openly be wrong is the easiest way to create the opportunity to learn what is right.

And that is why I have committed to starting this blog.

I know not everything I share here will be correct and my hope is that, together, we can all learn what is right.

## What's Next?

I have worked on some interesting projects recently that I want to share. Hopefully what I have to share will help others and generate feedback which can only lead to better solutions for everyone, myself included.

I am currently working on articles and sample code for the following topics:

- Using [Nx](https://nx.dev) together with [CircleCI and dynamic configuration](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/dynamic-config/)
- Building [.NET 6 Minimal APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0) with [nx-dotnet](https://www.nx-dotnet.com/)

If these topics interest you, please bookmark my blog. I will be sure to [post updates on twitter](https://twitter.com/kenniejaydavis) when new posts are published. And of course, feedback is a gift, so if I publish anything that is wrong, do not hesitate to offer the correct answer.
